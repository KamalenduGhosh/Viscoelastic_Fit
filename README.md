# Viscoelastic_Fit

MATLAB Code to find the viscoelastic material parameters of Non Gaussian Rubber with deformation enhanced shear thinning. Check out the publication describing the model: http://pamies.cee.illinois.edu/Publications_files/CRM_2016.pdf

Check out our recent publications incorporating a Neo-Hookean version (with constant viscosity) of this model in a homogenization setting: http://pamies.cee.illinois.edu/Publications_files/JMPS2021c.pdf &
